This is the image which represents the restaurants in nice (the information of these restaurants are retrived from firebase.)

The pin of "YKW" is the user's location (simulated by the address of Galeries Lafayette).

## Next Steps to do:
1. use K-means to cluster these annotations
2. enable the function of direction/route so that the user is allowed to find any restaurant showed on this map
